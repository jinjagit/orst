Working through the [Crust of Rust: Sorting Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4RkCyJyXmM) livestream, by Jon Gjenset.

Note: The Crust of Rust streams are not just good for understanding the topics presented, but also for understanding the details of Rust, and for learning how to interpret and use the Rust documentation.
